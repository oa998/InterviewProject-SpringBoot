TODO:

You need to do two major things with this part of the project:

1.  We have 500 rows of staff data that needs to be added to the database from the `employee.csv` file.  This has to
    be done first.  Figure out a way to get all the data into the database without mistakes.  Liquibase should be the
    only way that you modify the database for this project.

2.  We need to expose a way to get any user by their id in the database. This will be useful if we make it to the final
    stages of implementing functionality to the React part of the project.
